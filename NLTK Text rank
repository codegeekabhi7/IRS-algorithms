example_text ="I am not a military historian today, but it was the Second World War that first got
me interested in becoming a historian. When I was a child, I used to sit at the table with my
grandfather as he told me stories about the war. The son of a Jewish family that had fled Poland, he
joined the British army when the war started. He wanted to hit back against the Germans who had
driven his family from their home. What I remember most about Grandpa Dan, aside from his
medals and memorabilia, was an account of the Battle of Monte Cassino. That was when he, an
officer leading Polish troops in British uniform, fought alongside an army of Indian, New Zealand,
French-speaking African, and American soldiers against Germans on top of a mountain in Italy. A
world war indeed. But in general, we date the beginning of the Second World War to Germany's
September 1939 invasion of Poland. That attack finally provoked Britain and France, who had
armies that could actually confront the Axis Powers. Britain and France had been reluctant to
confront these expansionist states. But Poland had alliances with France, and more recently with
Britain. So when Germany invaded Poland, the British had to react. So, by late 1939, Britain and
France (and their colonies) were at war with Germany."
